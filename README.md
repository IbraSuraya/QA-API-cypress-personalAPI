## About
---
- This project is based on following a <a href="https://buildwithangga.com/kelas/qa-engineer-api-testing-with-cypress" target="_blank">BWA</a> course titled QA-API-Cypress.
- The tested API is the property of the course, so it cannot be attached.
- The tests carried out consist of manual tests [Docs Testing] and automation tests with the cypress tool.
- Although this was the result of the course, the project was developed further. The test documentation was made more detailed by following many industry standard references.
  - <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">'as soon as possible'</a>
- Automation tests were created by adjusting the clean code format.
- Here's a short video explaining this testing project. <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">[Click Me]</a>
